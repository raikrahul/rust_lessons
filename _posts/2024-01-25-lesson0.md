# Lesson 0: Hello World in Rust üåü

Welcome to the very first lesson of **Rust Lessons**! In this tutorial, we'll create your first Rust program: the famous "Hello, World!" Let's get started.

---

## üìù What You'll Learn
By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:
- How to write and run a simple Rust program.
- The basic structure of a Rust application.

---

## üöß Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Installed Rust on your system. If not, follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## ‚ú® Writing Your First Program

Here‚Äôs the simplest program in Rust:


```
fn main() { 
    // Function Definition (1)
    // - `fn` is the keyword that declares a function in Rust.
    // - `main` is a special function name where the program execution begins.
    // - It does not accept any arguments here (i.e., empty parentheses).
    // - Why `main`? The Rust compiler looks specifically for a `main` function as the entry point.
    // - Expansion for understanding: Imagine this is an address to which the program directly jumps when executed. 
    //   Other functions exist as "secondary stops" along the way.

    println!("Hello, World!"); 
    // Printing a String (2)
    // - `println!` is a Rust macro (indicated by the `!` symbol).
    //   - Unlike functions, macros are expanded at compile time.
    //   - This makes `println!` efficient, as it avoids runtime decisions for string formatting.
    // - The `println!` macro sends formatted output to the standard output (console).
    // - `"Hello, World!"` is a hardcoded string literal:
    //   - Length: 13 characters (including punctuation and spaces).
    //   - Stored in memory as a UTF-8 byte array: [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33].
    // - How does it work?
    //   - `println!` internally uses the `write!` macro to send the string to the standard output stream.
    //   - Behind the scenes, it invokes system calls like `write()` on UNIX or `WriteFile()` on Windows.
    // - Considerations:
    //   - Escaping characters: Strings in Rust support escape sequences like `\n` for new lines.
    //   - Formatting support: `println!` can interpolate variables (e.g., `println!("x = {}", x);`).
