# Lesson 1: Variables and Data Types in Rust 🔢

Welcome to **Lesson 1**! In this tutorial, we'll dive into variables and data types in Rust, a statically typed language that ensures type safety and performance. Let’s explore!

## 📝 What You'll Learn
By the end of this lesson, you’ll understand:
- The difference between mutable and immutable variables.
- How Rust handles data types.
- Writing efficient and safe code with Rust's type system.

## 🔍 Variables in Rust

In Rust, variables are **immutable by default**. If you need to change their value, you can make them mutable with the `mut` keyword.

### Immutable Variables
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // Immutable variable
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
