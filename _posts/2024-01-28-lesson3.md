## 🏛️ Defining Structs

```rust
// Define a struct
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    // Instantiate a struct
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("user@example.com"),
        username: String::from("rustacean42"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    
    println!("User {} has email {}", user1.username, user1.email);
}
