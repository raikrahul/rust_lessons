# Lesson 1: Variables and Data Types in Rust

In this lesson, we'll explore how to work with variables and data types in Rust. Rust is a statically typed language, which means every variable's type is known at compile time. Let's dive in!

## Variables in Rust
In Rust, you declare variables using the `let` keyword. By default, variables are **immutable** (cannot be changed after assignment). To make a variable mutable, use the `mut` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Immutable variable
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

    // Mutable variable
    let mut y = 10;
    y = 20; // This is allowed because y is mutable
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
